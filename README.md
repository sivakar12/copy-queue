# Copy Queue

A better UI/UX for those who copy and paste a lot of files and folders. 

Problems with using the OS's file manager to copy and paste
- Parallel copy is slow operation
  - You can choose speed but then you have to wait for one operation to finish before starting the next
  - Or, you can start the next while copying is in progress and all operations slow done.
- Too many windows are open. You go back and forth. Context switching is mentally taxing.
